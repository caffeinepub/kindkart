  "summary": "Diff updates chat seeding in ChatContext by lowercasing roles and providing dummy threads/messages for User, NGO, and (partially shown) DeliveryPartner. There is no evidence of the required empty-thread UI fallback in the Messages drawer, and Admin seeding/unread badge behavior cannot be confirmed from the truncated diff. Additional changes to project metadata files appear unrelated to the requested UI-only fix.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix chat seeding so the message drawer is not empty for any authenticated role (User, NGO, DeliveryPartner, Admin) by normalizing the session role values to the values expected by the chat seeding logic, and ensure each role has at least one dummy thread with at least one message.",
      "reason": "The diff shows seeded threads for 'user' and 'ngo' and begins 'deliverypartner', but there is no visible seeding for 'admin' in the provided truncated content. Also, the acceptance criteria about the unread badge/icon rendering is not evidenced anywhere in the diff summary.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Add a safe UI fallback in the chat drawer so that if threads are empty for any reason, the drawer displays a dummy welcome conversation preview (participant name, last message, timestamp) instead of an empty state.",
      "reason": "No UI component / drawer rendering changes are shown. Only ChatContext seeding logic is modified; there is no evidence of a placeholder conversation preview when thread list is empty.",
